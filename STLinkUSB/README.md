# STLinkUSB

This package contains a Haskell driver for ST-Link USB dongles.
My use case for this driver is the STM32-Zombie library.
The STM32-Zombie library turns a STM32 micro-controller
into a powerful Haskell-hackable hardware interface.
The library is a based on information from the openocd library.
